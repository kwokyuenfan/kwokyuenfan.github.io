This study examines how institutional factors shape the selective engagement of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) across different regions. The resource-based view suggests that REITs may prioritize social and governance practices over environmental investment due to resource constraints. Analyzing 302 REITs from the U.S., Europe, and Asia (2012-2022), our study finds that institutional factors—environmental policy strictness and investor attitudes—lead to different outcomes: selective ESG strategies enhance profitability and market valuation in the U.S. but reduce them in Europe. These findings emphasize the critical role of institutional contexts in shaping corporate sustainability.
