## Abstract
This paper investigates the role of financial technology (fintech) in enhancing household resilience to climate change impacts, focusing on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms. As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe due to climate change, households face increasing financial challenges in recovering from disasters. This study examines how P2P lending platforms can provide alternative financing options to improve household climate resilience, particularly for vulnerable populations. The research analyzes loan data, borrower characteristics, and climate shock variables to assess the effectiveness of fintech solutions in post-disaster recovery and climate adaptation financing.

## Key Findings
- P2P lending platforms provide faster access to credit for households affected by climate disasters
- Fintech solutions offer more flexible repayment terms compared to traditional banking services
- Vulnerable populations benefit disproportionately from fintech-based climate resilience financing
- Digital financial inclusion plays a critical role in enhancing community-level climate adaptation
- P2P lending can complement traditional disaster relief and insurance mechanisms

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the emerging literature on fintech and climate resilience by highlighting the potential of digital finance to address climate change adaptation challenges at the household level. The findings have important implications for policymakers, financial institutions, and climate change practitioners seeking innovative solutions to enhance community resilience.
