## Abstract
This paper investigates corporate lobbying strategies in response to climate change policy uncertainty and their environmental and financial implications. As governments worldwide develop and revise climate policies, corporations face significant regulatory uncertainty that influences their strategic decision-making. This study analyzes how firms navigate this uncertainty through lobbying activities, focusing on the strategies employed, their determinants, and their consequences for both environmental outcomes and firm performance. The research combines data on corporate lobbying expenditures, climate policy developments, firm characteristics, and environmental performance metrics to provide a comprehensive analysis of climate lobbying dynamics.

## Key Findings
- Corporate lobbying on climate change increases during periods of heightened policy uncertainty
- Firms employ different lobbying strategies based on their industry, size, and environmental exposure
- Proactive lobbying (supporting climate regulations) versus defensive lobbying (opposing regulations) yield different outcomes
- Climate lobbying has significant implications for firms' environmental performance and carbon emissions
- The financial consequences of climate lobbying vary depending on the alignment with subsequent policy developments

## Research Implications
This study contributes to our understanding of corporate political strategy in the context of climate change and provides insights for policymakers, investors, and corporate managers. The findings highlight the complex relationship between corporate political activities, climate policy, and sustainable development goals, offering guidance for stakeholders seeking to navigate the intersection of business, politics, and environmental sustainability.
