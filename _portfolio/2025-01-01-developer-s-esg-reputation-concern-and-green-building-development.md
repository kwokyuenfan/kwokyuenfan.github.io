## Abstract
This paper investigates the relationship between real estate developers' ESG reputation concerns and their investments in green building development. As environmental sustainability becomes increasingly important in the real estate sector, developers face growing pressure from investors, regulators, and consumers to adopt greener practices. This study examines how reputation concerns influence development decisions, project characteristics, and financial outcomes. The research analyzes data from real estate developers, project-level green building certifications, market performance metrics, and reputation indicators to understand the role of ESG reputation in driving sustainable development practices.

## Key Findings
- Developers with stronger ESG reputation concerns are more likely to pursue green building certifications
- Reputation-motivated green building investments are associated with higher project quality and sustainability standards
- ESG reputation concerns influence the scale and location choices of green building projects
- Reputation-driven green development yields positive financial returns through premium pricing and lower operating costs
- Developer ESG reputation creates positive spillover effects on neighboring properties and communities

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on sustainable real estate development and corporate reputation management. The findings have important implications for developers, investors, policymakers, and sustainability advocates seeking to promote greener building practices. The research highlights the significant role of reputation mechanisms in driving voluntary sustainability improvements in the real estate sector.
