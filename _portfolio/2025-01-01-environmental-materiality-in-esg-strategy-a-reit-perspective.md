## Abstract
This paper examines how environmental materiality impacts ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment strategies, with a specific focus on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). We analyze the relationship between REITs' environmental disclosures, materiality assessments, and financial performance. Our findings indicate that material environmental factors significantly influence REIT performance, while immaterial factors have little to no impact. The study provides insights into how investors can more effectively incorporate environmental considerations into their investment decisions through materiality-based approaches.

## Key Findings
- Environmental materiality significantly impacts REIT performance and sustainability outcomes
- Material environmental factors show stronger correlations with financial performance than immaterial factors
- REITs that effectively identify and disclose material environmental factors demonstrate better operational efficiency
- Materiality-based ESG strategies outperform broader ESG approaches in the real estate sector
- The materiality of environmental factors varies across different REIT subsectors (office, retail, residential, etc.)

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the growing literature on materiality in ESG investing and provides practical guidance for REIT managers, investors, and policymakers. The findings suggest that a materiality-focused approach to ESG strategy can lead to more efficient resource allocation and improved financial performance in the real estate sector.
