## Abstract
This paper investigates the effect of environmental regulatory independence on corporate environmental performance using China's environmental supervision system reform as a quasi-natural experiment. We find that the reform significantly improved corporate environmental performance by enhancing regulatory independence. The results suggest that regulatory independence strengthens environmental enforcement, reduces regulatory capture, and promotes better compliance among firms. We provide empirical evidence on how institutional design of environmental regulation affects corporate environmental behavior.

## Key Findings
- Environmental regulatory independence significantly improves corporate environmental performance
- The reform enhances environmental enforcement intensity and reduces regulatory capture
- The effect is more pronounced for firms in heavily polluting industries
- Regulatory independence has stronger impacts in regions with lower initial environmental governance quality
- The reform leads to a reduction in environmental violations and improvements in pollution emissions

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on environmental regulation and corporate behavior. The findings have important policy implications for designing effective environmental regulatory systems that can promote better environmental performance. The research suggests that enhancing regulatory independence should be a key consideration in environmental governance reforms.
