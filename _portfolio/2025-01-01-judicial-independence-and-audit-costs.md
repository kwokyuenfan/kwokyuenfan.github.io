## Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of judicial independence on audit costs. Using a comprehensive sample of firms across multiple jurisdictions, we find that higher judicial independence is associated with lower audit costs. The results suggest that strong judicial systems provide better protection for auditors and reduce the litigation risk they face, allowing for more efficient audit processes. We also find that the effect is more pronounced for firms in industries with higher litigation risk and for firms with more complex operations.

## Key Findings
- Judicial independence has a significant negative impact on audit costs
- Strong judicial systems reduce litigation risk for auditors, leading to more efficient audits
- The effect is more pronounced for firms in high-litigation-risk industries
- Judicial independence affects audit costs through multiple channels, including reduced legal liability concerns and improved contract enforcement
- Firms with more complex operations benefit more from judicial independence in terms of audit cost reduction

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on audit pricing and the role of legal institutions in financial markets. The findings have important implications for firms, auditors, and policymakers seeking to understand how legal institutions affect the cost of financial reporting. The research suggests that strengthening judicial independence can lead to more efficient audit markets and reduce the compliance burden for firms.
