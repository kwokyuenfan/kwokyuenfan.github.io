## Abstract
This paper investigates the relationship between leverage constraints and financial manipulation in the real estate sector. We find that real estate firms facing tighter leverage constraints are more likely to engage in financial manipulation, particularly through earnings management and off-balance sheet financing. Our analysis reveals that these firms use various techniques to artificially reduce leverage ratios and maintain access to credit markets. We also find that financial manipulation increases during periods of regulatory tightening and when firms face higher refinancing pressure.

## Key Findings
- Real estate firms facing leverage constraints are more likely to engage in financial manipulation
- Firms use earnings management and off-balance sheet financing to artificially reduce leverage ratios
- The effect is more pronounced during periods of regulatory tightening
- Firms with higher refinancing pressure show stronger evidence of financial manipulation
- Financial manipulation is associated with higher future financial distress risk

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on financial reporting quality, regulatory arbitrage, and real estate finance. The findings have important implications for regulators, investors, and financial institutions monitoring real estate firms. The research suggests that leverage constraints can create unintended consequences by incentivizing financial manipulation, highlighting the need for more sophisticated regulatory approaches that account for potential gaming of the system.
