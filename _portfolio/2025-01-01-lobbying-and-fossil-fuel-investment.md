## Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of fossil fuel lobbying on corporate investment decisions. Using data on lobbying expenditures and investment patterns of energy companies, we find that firms engaging in more fossil fuel lobbying invest more heavily in fossil fuel assets and less in renewable energy. The results suggest that lobbying can influence corporate strategy by creating a more favorable regulatory environment for fossil fuel investments, reducing the need for companies to transition to cleaner energy sources. We also find that the effect is stronger for firms with higher exposure to regulatory risks and for firms with stronger political connections.

## Key Findings
- Fossil fuel lobbying is positively associated with investments in fossil fuel assets
- Firms engaging in more fossil fuel lobbying allocate less capital to renewable energy projects
- The effect is stronger for firms with higher regulatory risk exposure
- Political connections amplify the relationship between lobbying and fossil fuel investment
- Lobbying affects investment decisions by influencing regulatory outcomes and policy expectations

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on corporate political activity and environmental economics. The findings have important implications for policymakers, investors, and environmental advocates concerned about the transition to a low-carbon economy. The research suggests that fossil fuel lobbying may slow the energy transition by encouraging continued investment in carbon-intensive assets, highlighting the need for policies that counteract these effects.
