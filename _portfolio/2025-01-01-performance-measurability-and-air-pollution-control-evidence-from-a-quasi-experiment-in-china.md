## Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of performance measurability on environmental policy effectiveness using China's introduction of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) as a quasi-natural experiment. We find that the introduction of CEMS significantly improved air pollution control by enhancing the measurability of environmental performance. The results suggest that performance measurability strengthens accountability, reduces information asymmetry, and improves regulatory enforcement. We provide empirical evidence on how technological innovation in monitoring can enhance environmental governance effectiveness.

## Key Findings
- The introduction of CEMS significantly reduced air pollution emissions
- Performance measurability improves accountability and regulatory enforcement
- The effect is more pronounced for firms with higher initial pollution levels
- CEMS adoption leads to more efficient environmental management practices
- The impact varies across regions, with stronger effects in areas with stricter environmental regulations

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on environmental policy effectiveness and performance measurement. The findings have important implications for policymakers designing environmental monitoring and enforcement systems. The research suggests that improving performance measurability through technological innovation can significantly enhance environmental policy effectiveness.
