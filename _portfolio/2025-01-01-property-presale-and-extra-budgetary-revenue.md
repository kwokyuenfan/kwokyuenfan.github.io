## Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of property presale systems on local government extra-budgetary revenue. Using data from Chinese cities, we find that the property presale system significantly increases local government extra-budgetary revenue through various channels, including land sales, property taxes, and fees. The results suggest that the presale system provides local governments with a reliable source of off-budget financing, allowing them to fund infrastructure projects and other expenditures outside the formal budgetary process. We also find that the effect is more pronounced in cities with higher real estate development activity and less developed financial markets.

## Key Findings
- The property presale system significantly increases local government extra-budgetary revenue
- Extra-budgetary revenue increases through multiple channels, including land sales and property-related fees
- The effect is more pronounced in cities with higher real estate development activity
- Less developed financial markets strengthen the relationship between presale systems and extra-budgetary revenue
- The presale system provides local governments with flexibility in financing infrastructure projects

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on local public finance, real estate markets, and urban economics. The findings have important implications for policymakers seeking to understand and regulate the relationship between real estate development and local government finances. The research suggests that the property presale system plays a crucial role in local government financing, with both benefits and potential risks that need to be carefully managed.
