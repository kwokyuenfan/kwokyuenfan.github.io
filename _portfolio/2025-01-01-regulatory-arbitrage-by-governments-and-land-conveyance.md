## Abstract
This paper investigates the phenomenon of regulatory arbitrage by local governments in land conveyance. Using data from Chinese cities, we find that local governments frequently engage in regulatory arbitrage to attract investment and generate revenue. The results suggest that governments exploit differences in land use regulations, environmental standards, and other rules to create competitive advantages for their jurisdictions. We provide empirical evidence on how regulatory arbitrage affects land market outcomes, investment patterns, and environmental quality.

## Key Findings
- Local governments actively engage in regulatory arbitrage in land conveyance processes
- Governments exploit regulatory differences to attract investment and generate revenue
- Regulatory arbitrage affects land prices, development patterns, and environmental outcomes
- The practice is more prevalent in regions with intense economic competition
- Regulatory arbitrage can lead to inefficient resource allocation and environmental degradation

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on regulatory competition, local government behavior, and land economics. The findings have important implications for policymakers seeking to understand and regulate intergovernmental competition in land markets. The research suggests that regulatory arbitrage can have both positive and negative consequences, highlighting the need for coordinated approaches to land use regulation.
