## Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of pandemic fear on residential rental prices using Hong Kong as a case study. We find that pandemic fear, measured by COVID-19 case numbers and search intensity for pandemic-related terms, significantly reduced residential rental prices. The results suggest that health concerns and movement restrictions during the pandemic led to decreased demand for rental housing, particularly in densely populated areas and neighborhoods with higher infection rates. We provide empirical evidence on how public health crises affect housing market dynamics.

## Key Findings
- Pandemic fear significantly reduced residential rental prices in Hong Kong
- The effect is more pronounced in densely populated areas and neighborhoods with higher infection rates
- Search intensity for pandemic-related terms predicts rental price movements
- The impact varies across property types, with larger apartments showing smaller price declines
- Rental prices began recovering as pandemic fears subsided and restrictions were lifted

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on housing market dynamics during public health crises. The findings have important implications for real estate investors, landlords, and policymakers navigating housing markets during pandemics. The research suggests that health-related shocks can have significant but temporary effects on rental markets, with recovery potential as public health concerns abate.
