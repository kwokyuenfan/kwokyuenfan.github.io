## Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of unfinished buildings on mortgage loan suspension. Using data from Chinese homebuyers, we find that the risk of unfinished buildings significantly increases the likelihood of mortgage loan suspension. The results suggest that when homebuyers perceive their housing projects as at risk of remaining unfinished, they are more likely to stop making mortgage payments. We provide empirical evidence on how housing project completion risks affect financial stability and household behavior.

## Key Findings
- The risk of unfinished buildings significantly increases mortgage loan suspension rates
- Homebuyers strategically suspend mortgage payments when project completion is uncertain
- The effect is more pronounced for projects with higher construction delays and financial difficulties
- Loan suspension rates vary across regions, with stronger effects in areas with higher housing market uncertainty
- The practice of "stop paying mortgages on unfinished homes" can create systemic financial risks

## Research Implications
This study contributes to the literature on mortgage default behavior and housing market risks. The findings have important implications for financial institutions, policymakers, and homebuyers navigating housing markets with completion risks. The research suggests that ensuring housing project completion is crucial for maintaining financial stability in the mortgage market.
