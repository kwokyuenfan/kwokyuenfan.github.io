excerpt: 'The beta anomaly in the REIT market and providing evidence that it is driven by institutional investors' preference for high-beta assets, which supports the leverage constraints hypothesis over alternative explanations. This institutional demand inflates the prices of high-beta REITs, causing their subsequent risk-adjusted underperformance and creating profitable opportunities for strategies that bet against beta.'
