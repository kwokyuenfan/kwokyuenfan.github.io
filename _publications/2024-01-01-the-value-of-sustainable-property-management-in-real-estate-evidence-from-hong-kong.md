excerpt: "ESG performance of property management companies is capitalized into housing prices, with the value premium driven by a reduction in perceived risk and a higher rental growth rate rather than by higher gross rents. Management firms can directly enhance property values by improving ESG practices, and investors should incorporate this non-physical attribute into their valuations."
